pariing mode 8 digits for now .
new page: delete the dvices page no scanning for devices add a secuity page instead

new page: we wil need a passowrd to login user and passowrd the on the begiinng popoup page

put the key on both devices (the key )
  it is stored on the devices both devices
  have an option for the user to delete the code if they believie they have bee n comproomiszed(security page)

have a button on the app that tells the lora to show the key code on the lora device
  the button calls from the api
  gernate a new pairing code on one device
  if there is now code generated previously it tells the device to gernerate the code


this is how the flow would work,
assuming we got 2 new devices
  got to pairing mode on c1
  hit show pairing key number button
  on the device it will say "no detected key gerenating key"
  now we go to c2 go to the pairing page
  enter a device pairing key
  so you eneter the generated key that is dispalyed on the lora 1
  press enter
  it will send taht key to lora 2
  now if you send a message from lora 1 to 2 it would understand it
