limitations
	messages can only have 8 sequences


Unaccounted for issues. 
	If a sequence number is chosen that is currently in the buffer, but this one has different data, then trouble will arise. 
		We should probably choose a larger size


TODO
	Proper State control
	Processing of messages after they get fully dumped in the rxMessageArray
		We will probably have it be served straight to the Serial buffer
	Sending messages to txMessageArray
	Think about where critical sections might be needed




Problems:
	"Failed to allocate space in txMessageBuffer" when sending multiple messages
		Malloc failes if there is already an allocation, we should probably just do some malloc tests

Potential things to do to increase reliability:
	Add OOB read/write detection to each buffer instance
